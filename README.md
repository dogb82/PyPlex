# PyPlex
PyPlex Theme for Pyload

This Theme it's inspired by PlexPy (https://github.com/JonnyWong16/plexpy) A Python based monitoring and tracking tool for Plex Media Server. That's why I've choosen the name PyPlex for this theme.

I'm not yet satisfied with the look and feel and that's why I wont release it yet. I did not finish the login and logout page yet but I'm getting there very soon.

For now these are some screenshots on how it looks now:
